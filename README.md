LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. It is one-of-many diode types in power electronic. It can act as a diode to hold current from flowing in the opposite direction and allows current flowing from the desired direction.

Blinking LED circuit is a simple circuit which is made for flashing LED lights in specific pattern like the digital screen to make an image or text.

It also is made with a random blinking pattern for Christmas decoration lamp. Its main purpose is to make some LEDs blinking.

There are several ways to flash LED lights such as using a simple relay, Schmitt Trigger Inverter, various logic gate, microcontroller, transistor, or even transistor combined with a microcontroller.

If the LED transition is too fast, you can use time delay consisting of a resistor and a capacitor to delay the transition with a charging capacitor principle
Supplies


Component List

To make blinking led light circuit, we might need some electronics component.

All components list have been given below –

Component List – 

•	Timer IC – NE 555

•	Resistor – 10 KΩ and 20 KΩ

•	Capacitor – 2.2µf/ 50v

•	Ceramic Capacitor – 103

•	LED – 5mm (12 pieces)

•	Power Source – DC 12v



NE-555 Pinout

We will go over the pinout of the 555 timer. The 555 timer is an 8-pin IC. This means it has 8 different pins, each of which have different functions for the IC.

The 555 timer can be used for basic timing functions, create warning lights that flash on and off, produce musical notes of varying frequencies, and even control the control position of a servo motor.

•	GND Pin

•	Trigger Pin

•	Output Pin

•	Reset Pin

•	Control Voltage

•	Threshold Pin

•	Discharge pin

•	Supply Terminal


Features of the NE-555 Timer IC

•	It can be operated in +5V, can withstand up to +18V.

•	The source and sink current of the output pin is near about 200mA.

•	Trigger Voltage is 1.6 when operating at +5V.

•	Operating Temperature is near about 70 degrees Celsius.

•	It is available in 8-pin PDIP, SOIC, and VSSOP packages.

•	The duty cycle of the 555 timers can be variable as per user need.


Applications of the NE-555 Timer IC

The 555 timer is one of the most widely used integrated chips in digital electronics.
Some common uses and application of 555 timers IC are as follows.


• It is used for Pulse, Waveform, and square wave generation.

• It is also used in time delay generation, precision timing, and sequential timing.

• It can be used as a mono-stable multi-vibrator and a-stable multi-vibrator.

• It is mostly used in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) & PPM (Pulse Position Modulation).

• Used in Tachometers & temperature measurement.

• Commonly used in DC Voltage Regulators.

• Used for conversion like Voltage to Frequency Converter.

• It is also used in Frequency Divider.

• It is used in the Pulse detector.

• It can be used to design a Timer Switch.


Hardware of SMT Project Circuit

To make this mini power amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly.

Schematics and PCB Design

The schematics of PCBs can be seen above. Power supply don’t included with the circuit. You can use any 9v battery for this project. For better effect, you can use different colors LED light and can place them in a rhythm.


Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this circuit, we need to follow a normal method of this time IC. 1st we need to connect 2 and 6 no leg of timer IC-NE555. Then we connect 4 and 8 no leg of NE-555 timer IC. It is a common connection for NE555 IC circuit. 

Specially, if you want to make a LED light effect project. Remember, to make led light flasher circuit using NE-555 ic you might need this connection.


Circuit Connection – Step 2

Now we connect 100µf/ 35v capacitor with the circuit. We connect capacitor negative leg with 1no leg of timer IC and connect capacitor positive leg with 2no leg of timer IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 3

To make this circuit, we are using 68 KΩ resistor. We also can use 1KΩ and 68 KΩ resistor to make this circuit. To make this circuit, we need to make a parallel connection between one terminal of this two resistor. We connect parallel side with 7no led of timer IC and connect two different terminal with 6 and 8 no leg of timer IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 4

For better effect, we are using 12 piece led light circuit. We divide this led into 2 side. Then each side will contain 6 LEDS. Then we make a parallel connection in this 6 LEDS.

Now we make a series connection in this two side LEDS. Now we get 3 side . Connect this series side with 3no leg of timer IC. Connect negative side led with 4 no leg of timer IC and positive side led with 4no leg of timer IC.


Soldering And Cleaning

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.
